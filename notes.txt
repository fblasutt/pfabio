-I do not understand the decomposition on the effect on pension credits. I think that
 total effect=(baseline credits+behavioral effect)*1.5

-By having marginal employment we should be ablt to match the effect on pension credits

-Harder to match the effect on earnings: massive effect, I suspect there are some
 women switchin employment *within* category full/part time/marginal. Hoepfully
 we will not miss to much

-The model has a very hard time matching the effect of the reform on employment. Need
 to try with different utility functions. *Solved*: just increase the intertemporal
 elasticity of substutution!

-Identification works ok, not great because of the dicrete choice. In principle we would 
 like to have a large tast shock, but this mechanically decrease the effect of the
 reform (preferences starts to matter more than invcentives). Combining this with
 point above could be a nice way to go. On the same lines: if I decrease the level of
 the target effect and increase to taste shock size, identification works as it should.
 Moreover, having more agents does help for "perfect" indetification. See *solution*
 above!

- One nice thing: the effect on the gender wage gap + the conclusion about tax rate vs
  cargiver credits reforms seems pretty robust to changing the elasticity of substitution!

- Interpretation of results: the heterogeneous effect by initial earnings makes sense if
  richer women i) live longer, ii) are more patient. I bet both are true, to be checked.


- Artmann, schundlen, Giupponi: include their effect on income effects (thats what they do)
  as an expreiment

- LABOR SUPPLY AND THE PENSION-CONTRIBUTION LINK (French , linder,..) Differeny kind of policy
  (before: only best 10 yrs matter for pension, after everything matter) and more at men. Reform
  was gradual for women (anticipation) and they find smaller effects.

 - *Important* Need to have more realistic rules: get benefits also from children 0-3 + rules also
    are different for 2+ children...
