- Getting right the effect on pension points (with and without CC) AND earnings very hard to
  do. Are there any effects on hourly wages? Starting point: the "mechanical" cargiver credits
  computed at baseline should be < 0.05.

- Effect on ernings (all) and earnings conditional on working. Not sure I understand this
- Interpretation of results: the heterogeneous effect by initial earnings makes sense if
  richer women i) live longer, ii) are more patient. I bet both are true, to be checked.

- Interpretation of results. Not straighforward the share of people moving from marginal to
  regular employment. The increase in hrs of marg->regular may be compensated by some women
  decreasing their intensive margin of hours to take advantage of the reform. Question: what
  would have happened if the reform was not limited to 1 point?

- Is the reform from age 3 or 4 of children?

- About the retroactive rule: is it for children born after 1992?
