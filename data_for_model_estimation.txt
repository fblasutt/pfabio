Important question: should we focus on women with a partner? For now, I think so. If yes, all the moments should be constructed
with this group of people. Also, what do to with women with 2+ more children? drop them from the sample for the estimation of the
structural model? Otherwise, I can add exogenous fertility to the model. I think that if results are similar for the "cut sample"
(e.g., only couples with 1 child) I would use the cut sample. 


***1) Earnings/wages

Divide men (women) into N groups: groups should be associated with different expected life-time earnings (potential wages) of 
men (women). The groups can be based on education (better) or occupation. I think that the optimal N should be around 3-7. 

For each group of men (women), I need an estimation of the trend of average earnings (potential wages) by age.
For men, it is common to obtain the earnings profile by regressing earnings on a polinomial of age. The coefficients of the earnings polynomial is 
what I will use to run the model. For women,  the same can be done for wages (one needs to control for endogenous selection normally, but
maybe we can skip this for now?). For men for each group I also need an estimation of pension points at retirement to compute theri pension.


**2) Initial distribution (at age 30):

-net worth
-pension points
-income group of women and partner (see above).

You can create a dataset with the list of individuals in the sample, where for each household we have the variables above. If one or more of the
variables (e.g., net worth) come from a differnt dataset than the "baseline" one, it would be great to have the (discrete) distribution of these variable conditional
on the other charactheristics (e.g.: what is the distribution of networth for college graduates with 2 pension points...?)


**3) Target moments: 1) effect of the reform on employment (or pension points), 2) share of women employed, 3) share of women working part-time,
     4) share of women working in regular/marginal employment. Nontarteget moments: effect of the reform on
     marginal employment, full-time employment, pension points with and without caregiver credits. The sample for which we compute these moments should be consistent
     with the model (eg., only women with partner and children aged 3-20).
