Important question: should we focus on women with a partner?


***1) Earnings/wages

Divide men (women) into N groups: groups should be associated with different expected life-time earnings (potential wages) of 
men (women). The groups can be based on education or occupation. I think that the optimal N should be around 5-7. It would be great
if the share of people per group was similar.

For each group of men (women), I need an estimation of the trend of average earnings (potential wages) by age.
For men, it is common to obtain the earnings profile by regressing earnings on a polinomial of age. The coefficients of the earnings polynomial is 
what I will use to run the model. For women,  the same can be done for wages (one needs to control for endogenous selection normally, but
maybe we can skip this for now?). For men for each group I also need an estimation of pension points at retirement to compute theri pension.


**2) Initial distribution (at age 30):

-net worth
-pension points
-income group of women and partner (see above).

You can create a dataset with the list of individuals in the sample, where for each household we have the variables above.


**3) Target moments.

Effect of the reform on

1) hours worked
2) employment
3) part time/ marginal employment
4) pension point
5) earnings

Moreover, I need the average Share of women working, working into full employment, working part time/marginal employment. 
I need the moments above in three forms: aggregate, by age of the women, by "income group" of the women and the husband.

Bonus: does the effect of the reform depends on the *age* of the mother? This can help calibrate income effects. Maybe
we can leave this for later

**4) Additional data

Average number of hours worked for women into full employment and part time/ marginal employment.
Estimation of the wage penalty of working into part time/marginal employment: obtained using a ummy variable in the regression in 2)?
