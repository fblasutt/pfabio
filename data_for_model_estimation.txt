*Data for data estimation
**************************

Sample selection: same for the DiD estimates. Since in the main dataset we do not observe couples, I was thinking of modeling a unitary household
where the (exogenous) income of the men is 0 for single mothers. We consider households where women have 1 child only (let me know
if this is a problem).

The idea is to use one of the DiD estimates as target, while the others should be used as over-identification checks.


***1) Earnings/wages

Divide men (women) into N groups: groups should be associated with different expected life-time earnings (potential wages) of 
men (women). The groups can be based on education or occupation. I think that the optimal N should be around 3-7. 

For each group of men (women), I need an estimation of the trend of earnings (wages) by age.
For men, it is common to obtain the earnings profile by regressing w on a polinomial of age. The coefficients of the earnings polynomial is 
what I will use to run the model. For women,  the same can be done for wages (one needs to control for endogenous selection normally, but
maybe we can skip this for now?). For men for each group I also need an estimation of pension points at retirement to compute their pension.


**2) Initial distribution (age is equal for everyone and should be the median age at first birth):

-net worth: not strictly necessary: I suppose networth is low for young households. In the simulations it doesnt seem to matter so much.

-pension points first time they enter the sample
-income group of women and partner (see above).
-age of the child first time they enter the sample (should be 3 for treatment and 11 for control right?)
-calendar year first time they enter the sample


**3) Discretization of hours

We need to discretize hours on a grid. I try to illustrate this with one example.

The hours grid can be [0, 200, 1000, 1500, 2000] where each entry of the array is the average working hours of a people worknig in specific hours brackets.
For example 0 hours can simply be women who work 0 hours in a year. 300 hours is the average working hours of women who work more than 0 and less than 500 hours
in a year. 1000 hours is the avreage working hours of women more than 500 and less than 1300 hours....2000 is the average yearly hours of women working more than 1800 hours.
The idea is that the first entry in the grid represent nonparticipation, the second whould be mini-jobs, the last one full time employment, and all in between should be part-time
work. I think that having 2 entries for part-time work will be enough, but this can be changed.

*IMPORTANT* to match the data the choice of groups and hours brackets is important. The following should be true for the trated group befor the reform

$\sum_{j \in \text{GROUPS}}\sum_{i \in \text{HOURS GRID}} \pi_{ji} f(h_i  w_j)<0.05$

where GROUPS is the set containing the wage groups of women, HOURS GRID is a set containing the hour brackets,
$\pi_{ij}$ is the share of women in group $j$ choosing the $i$ hours worked bracket. 
$h_i$ is the average amount of hours worked of women in the $i$ hours bracket and $w_j$ is the hourly wage of women in the $j$ group. 
Finally, $f()$ is a function that determines the pension points earned given earnings $h_i  w_j$.

**4) Target moments. The following moments can be computed for the trated group before the reform and control group before the reform: share of women working in each hours bracket (minijobs, parttime, full time).
     Moreover, I will target one of the DiD results, leaving the others as overidentification checks.
